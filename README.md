# Game_of_Life
The Game of Life is a simple yet powerful simulation that demonstrates how complex behavior can emerge from a small set of simple rules.

# Game of Life in C++

## Introduction

This is an implementation of John Conway's Game of Life in C++. The Game of Life is a cellular automaton simulation where cells can be in either of two states: alive or dead. The state of each cell is determined by the state of its neighbors in the previous generation.

## Requirements
- A C++ compiler (e.g. GCC)
- SFML library for visualization

## Installation
# 1. Clone the repository:
git clone https://github.com/user/game-of-life-c++

# 2. Install SFML library:
sudo apt-get install libsfml-dev

# 3. Compile the source code:
g++ -o game-of-life main.cpp


## Usage
# Run the compiled binary:
./game-of-life

Use the mouse to create/remove cells and press the spacebar to start/pause the simulation.
